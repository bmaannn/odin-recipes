    <h3>Description</h3>

</p>

<p>
    Alfredo sauce is a creamy pasta sauce that's frequently paired with fettuccine.
     The iconic dish, fettuccine Alfredo, is an Italian menu staple. According to legend, 
     the dish was invented by a Roman chef named Alfredo di Lelio in the early 1900s. Di Lelio's 
     pregnant wife was struggling to keep any food down, so he tossed pasta in the simple buttery 
     sauce of his own creation. He added fettuccine Alfredo to his restaurant's menu soon after.

<p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>


    
<p>Traditional Alfredo sauce consists of butter, heavy cream, Parmesan cheese, and basic seasonings such as 
salt and pepper. This simple recipe, though, has a secret ingredient that speeds up the cooking process and 
makes it extra indulgent: cream cheese. Here's what you'll need to make Quick and Easy Alfredo Sauce:</p>

<ul>
 <li><strong>Butter</strong></li>

  <p>You can't make homemade Alfredo sauce without butter. The thick, velvety base adds creaminess and rich flavor. 
Make sure to use real butter for the most indulgent results. If you use unsalted butter, make sure to add salt to
taste.</p>

<li><strong>Cream Cheese</strong></li>
<p>Not only does cream cheese add thickness and pleasant tanginess, it eliminates the need to stand over the 
stove making a roux.</p>


<li><strong>Garlic Powder</strong></li>
<p>Two teaspoons of garlic powder add Italian-inspired flavor. For a stronger flavor, use fresh garlic.</p>

<li><strong>Milk</strong></li>
<p>Whole milk adds creaminess, richness, and helps create the perfect smooth texture.</p>

<li><strong>Parmesan Cheese</strong></li>

<p>Parmesan thickens the sauce and adds irresistible cheesy flavor. Grate your own block instead of using 
shredded cheese if you can. If you don't have Parmesan, you can try substituting Gruy√®re or mozzarella.
</p>

<li><strong>Pepper</strong></li>

</p>Aromatic black pepper adds depth and enhances the other flavors. It's the perfect finishing touch.</p>
</ul>

<p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
</p>

<p>
    <ol>
        <p><li>Gather all ingredients</li></p>

        <p><li>Melt butter in a medium, non-stick saucepan over medium heat. Add cream cheese and garlic powder, 
            stirring with a wire whisk until smooth. Add milk, a little at a time, whisking to smooth out lumps. 
            Stir in Parmesan cheese and pepper. </li></p>

        <p><li>Remove from heat when sauce reaches desired consistency. Sauce will thicken rapidly. Thin with milk 
            if cooked too long.</li></p>

        <p><li>Toss with hot pasta to serve.</li></p>
    </ol>
